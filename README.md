# Student Performance Predictor (Machine Learning Project)

## Overview

The Student Performance Predictor is a machine learning web application that predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on demographic and educational information.

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model comparison, model selection, and deployment using a Flask web application.

The system trains multiple machine learning models and automatically selects the **best performing model** for predictions.

## Features

- Multiple Machine Learning Models  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  

- Automatic Best Model Selection  
- Model Accuracy Comparison  
- Prediction Confidence Score  
- Web Interface built using Flask  
- Deployment Ready

---

## Dataset

This project uses the **Students Performance in Exams dataset**.

### Input Features

- Gender  
- Race / Ethnicity  
- Parental Level of Education  
- Lunch Type  
- Test Preparation Course  

### Target Variable

- Pass / Fail

The model predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on these features.
